Valaga by Valerie Haupt

Hello! This was a milestone project for my software development bootcamp to showcase some of the skills I had learned thus far. It was my first experience in dealing with HTML canvas and so might not be as polished as some.

Controls are simple and displayed on the first screen:
    Use the WASD keys to move
    Press the spacebar to fire

Additions I would have liked to add and might do in the future:
    adding more enemies
    adding a player shield for sustaining more hits
    some power ups

The project guidelines were to create a playable web browser game and I took some inspiration from the arcade games I used to play from when I was younger.

I used HTML, CCS, and Javascript with no further libraries. I've hosted the project on GitHub pages if you'd like to give it a try
